## MCMC models description

**MCMC_V2**
- Model: PD -> PD/D/H
- Mathematical model: PD -> PD/(D+H) -> D/H
- Variables: All but LDL and DBP
- Scaling: Yes
- Parameters: 8 + 8 (all selected variables in both transitions)

**MCMC_V3**
- Model: PD -> PD/D/H
- Mathematical model: PD -> PD/(D+H) -> D/H
- Variables: All but LDL and DBP
- Scaling: Yes
- Parameters: 1 + 8 (only baseline for first transition, all selected variables for second)

**MCMC_V4**
- Model: PD -> PD/D/H
- Mathematical model: PD -> H/(PD+D) -> PD/D
- Variables: All but LDL and DBP
- Scaling: Yes
- Parameters: 8 + 8 (all selected variables in both transitions)

**MCMC_V5**
- Model: D -> D/CVD
- Mathematical model: D/CVD

- Scaling: Yes
- Parameters: 4 (treatment coding for cluster membership)

**MCMC_V6**
- Model: D -> D/CVD
- Mathematical model: D/CVD
- Variables: Cluster membership based on T2D clusters from Clustering Model 3
